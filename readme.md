# Welcome to EpiCOGs

This is a sandbox environment that allows users to visualize primarily public health data.
This project is currently being developed by @amcrisan (contact : acrisan@cs.ubc.ca), so come back often for updates.

If you want to demo a version of the tool you can do so here:
https://amcrisan.shinyapps.io/EpiCOGSDEMO/

This demo version does not allow you to load your own data, but otherwise contains all the functionality of EpiCOGs.

If you'd like to know more about my research, what motivated it, and where this project is going, you can check out the presentation that is linked below:
